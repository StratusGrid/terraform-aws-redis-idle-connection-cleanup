/**
 * <p>Creates a Redis (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group.</p>
 *         <p>This API can be used to create a standalone regional replication group or a secondary replication group associated with a Global datastore.</p>
 *         <p>A Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group is a collection of clusters,
 *             where one of the clusters is a read/write primary and the others are read-only replicas.
 *             Writes to the primary are asynchronously propagated to the replicas.</p>
 *         <p>A Redis cluster-mode enabled cluster is comprised of from 1 to 90 shards (API/CLI: node groups).
 *             Each shard has a primary node and up to 5 read-only replica nodes. The configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number or replicas allowed.
 *
 *         </p>
 *         <p>The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the Redis engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. For example, you can choose to configure a 500 node cluster that ranges between
 *             83 shards (one primary and 5 replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single primary and no replicas). Make sure there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase.
 *             Common pitfalls include the subnets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or the subnets are shared and heavily used by other clusters. For more information, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/SubnetGroups.Creating.html">Creating a Subnet Group</a>. For versions below 5.0.6,
 *             the limit is 250 per cluster.</p>
 *         <p>To request a limit increase, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html">AWS Service Limits</a>
 *             and choose the limit type <b>Nodes per cluster per instance type</b>. </p>
 *         <p>When a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group has been successfully created,
 *             you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a total of 5 read replicas.
 *             If you need to increase or decrease the number of node groups (console: shards),
 *             you can avail yourself of ElastiCache for Redis' scaling. For more information,
 *             see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Scaling.html">Scaling ElastiCache for Redis Clusters</a> in the <i>ElastiCache User Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 *
 *         <note>
 *             <p>This operation is valid for Redis only.</p>
 *          </note>
